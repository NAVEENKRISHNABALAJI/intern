Web Api includes:
   Window object(Browser) gives:
    setTimeOut
    dom Api
    fetch
    localstorage
    consolelocation

All these features are availabe to us via call stack
#* Microtask queue-> all the callback functions that comes from promises and mutationobserver are placed in microtask queue
Generally the microtask queue has more priority that the callback queue.
Hence when the call stack is empty the eventloop pushes the contents from microtask then only it considers the callback queue
